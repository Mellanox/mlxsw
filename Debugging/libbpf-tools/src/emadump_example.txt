Demonstration of emadump.

EMADs (Ethernet Management Datagrams) are configuration packets
exchanged between the mlxsw driver and the underlying device/firmware
over a bus such as PCI or I2C. These packets are similar in nature to
the netlink packets exchanged between user space and kernel.

Each EMAD transaction initiated by the driver encodes a single register
and is either a request to write to the register or a request to query
from it.

emadump traces EMADs and dumps them to a PCAP file. By default, EMADs
are dumped to stdout, making it easy to pipe EMADs to Wireshark. For
example:

# ./emadump | tshark -X lua_script:../../EMADs/emad_dissector.lua -r -
    1   0.000000 Mellanox_01:02:03 _ Mellanox_00:00:01 EMAD 1212 Ethernet II
    2   0.000513 Mellanox_01:02:03 _ Mellanox_00:00:01 EMAD 1212 Ethernet II

Alternatively, EMADs can be dumped to a file for later inspection. For
example:

# ./emadump -f emads.pcap

It is also possible to filter only EMADs (request and response) that
took longer than a specified threshold in microseconds. For example:

# ./emadump -l 1000 -f emads.pcap

Finally, it is also possible to filter only EMADs that encountered some error
during processing. For example:

# ./emadump -e -f emads.pcap

USAGE message:

# ./emadump --help
Usage: emadump [OPTION...]
Dump EMADs to a PCAP file.

USAGE: emadump [--help] [-e] [-l] [-f] [-v]

EXAMPLES:
    emadump                # dump all EMADs to stdout
    emadump -e             # only dump EMADs (request & response) with errors
    emadump -l 1000        # only dump EMADs that took longer than 1000 usecs
    emadump -f emads.pcap  # dump EMADs to emads.pcap instead of stdout

  -e, --errors               Only dump EMADs with errors
  -f, --file=FILE            Dump EMADs to this file
  -l, --latency=LAT          Only dump EMADs that took longer than specified
                             threshold in microseconds
  -v, --verbose              Verbose debug output
  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message
  -V, --version              Print program version

Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.
