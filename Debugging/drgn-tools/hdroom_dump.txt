NAME

        hdroom_dump - Dump mlxsw headroom configuration

SYNOPSIS:

        hdroom_dump

DESCRIPTION:

        On Spectrum, port buffers, also called port headroom, is where packets
        are stored while they are parsed and the forwarding decision is being
        made. For lossless traffic flows, in case shared buffer admission is not
        allowed, headroom is also where to put the extra traffic received before
        the sent PAUSE takes effect. Another aspect of the port headroom is the
        so called internal buffer, which is used for packets that are mirrored
        due to triggers that the Spectrum ASIC considers "egress". Besides ACL
        mirroring on port egress this includes also packets mirrored due to ECN
        marking.

        hdroom_dump is a tool written on top of drgn, for dumping internal
        structures of mlxsw driver related to headroom management. That way it
        is possible to find out how headroom is configured in the ASIC.

OUTPUT

	As an output, hdroom_dump emits a JSON object with the following
	attributes:

	.cell_size
            Granularity of the chip memory. The same cell size is reported also
            through "devlink sb pool show".

        .max_headroom_cells
            Maximum number of cells that FW permits to configure for headroom
            on one port.

        .ports.<port-name>.mode
            "DCB" or "TC". In DCB mode, headroom is autoconfigured from ETS
            configuration. In "TC" mode, it is configured through the DCB
            buffer commands.

        .ports.<port-name>.mtu
            Current port MTU value in bytes.

        .ports.<port-name>.max_mtu
            Maximum MTU permitted on this port.

        .ports.<port-name>.max_speed
            Maximum speed of this port in Mbps.

        .ports.<port-name>.delay_bytes
            Number of bytes of delay configured through DCB PFC interface.

        .ports.<port-name>.prios.<prio>.ets_buf_idx
        .ports.<port-name>.prios.<prio>.set_buf_idx
        .ports.<port-name>.prios.<prio>.buf_idx
            The index of the buffer that should take traffic with priority
            <prio>, as configured through, respectively, DCB ETS, DCB buffer
            and that was actually configured in the ASIC.

        .ports.<port-name>.prios.<prio>.lossy
            Whether this priority is marked as lossy by the DCB PFC
            configuration.

        .ports.<port-name>.bufs.<buf>.size_cells
            Buffer size in cells.

        .ports.<port-name>.bufs.<buf>.thres_cells
            Buffer Xon/Xoff threshold in cells.

        .ports.<port-name>.bufs.<buf>.lossy
            Whether the given buffer is lossy. In Spectrum, lossiness is an
            attribute of a buffer, not of a priority, so this shows how the
            buffer was actually configured.

        .ports.<port-name>.int_buf.enable
            Whether the internal mirroring buffer is enabled, i.e. whether
            there are any mirroring sessions that are considered "egress".

        .ports.<port-name>.int_buf.size_cells
            Internal mirroring buffer size in cells.

        .ports.<port-name>.int_buf.reserve_cells
            Amount of space in cells that is always reserved in the headroom
            for the internal mirroring buffer.

	hdroom_dump always outputs the complete information. Filtering and
        querying can be done e.g. through `jq'.
