NAME

        mdb_table_dump - Dump mlxsw MDB (multicast group database)
        configuration

SYNOPSIS:

        mdb_table_dump

DESCRIPTION:

        mdb_table_dump is a tool written on top of drgn, for dumping internal
        structures of mlxsw driver related to MDB table. That way it is
        possible to find out how MDB entries are configured in the ASIC.
        In Linux, the MDB table is stored per bridge device, so the tool
        dumps the table per bridge device.

OUTPUT

        As an output, mdb_table_dump emits a JSON object with the following
        attributes:

        .<bridge-device-name>.<mid-index>.mac_address
            MAC address, the pair {MAC, FID} is used as an index to the
            multicast FDB table.

        .<bridge-device-name>.<mid-index>.fid_index
            FID index, the pair {MAC, FID} is used as an index to the
            multicast FDB table.

        .<bridge-device-name>.<mid-index>.mid_index
            MID index. This is the index to the PGT table which
            maintains a list of ports to transmit packets which point to
            the entry.

        .<bridge-device-name>.<mid-index>.ports_list
            List of ports which are configured in the PGT table in the
            relevant MID index. Packets which point to the MID index,
            will be transmitted to all the ports in the list.

        .<bridge-device-name>.<mid-index>.ports_list.<netdev>.local_port
            A local port to transmit the packet to.

        .<bridge-device-name>.<mid-index>.ports_list.<netdev>.refcount
            Reference counter of the port. MDB entries in the Linux bridge
            are keyed according to their multicast IP, when these entries
            are notified to device drivers via switchdev, the multicast IP
            is converted to a multicast MAC. This conversion might cause
            collisions, so port can be used more than once in MDB entry
            which is keyed by MAC.

        .<bridge-device-name>.<mid-index>.ports_list.<netdev>.mrouter
            Indicates if the port is multicast router or not. See more
            information in kernel commit d2994e1305858 ("mlxsw:
            spectrum_switchdev: Add support for maintaining list of ports per
            MDB entry")

        mdb_table_dump always outputs the complete information. Filtering
        and querying can be done e.g. through `jq`.

EXAMPLE:

    # ./mdb_table_dump | jq
    {
      "br0": {
        "15354": {
          "mac_address": "33:33:ff:82:bf:af",
          "fid_index": 1,
          "mid_index": 15354,
          "ports_list": {
            "swp28": {
              "local_port": 57,
              "refcount": 1,
              "mrouter": false
            }
          }
        },
        "15355": {
          "mac_address": "33:33:ff:f5:ee:1c",
          "fid_index": 1,
          "mid_index": 15355,
          "ports_list": {
            "swp26": {
              "local_port": 49,
              "refcount": 1,
              "mrouter": false
            },
            "swp25": {
              "local_port": 53,
              "refcount": 1,
              "mrouter": false
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
