NAME

        res_dump - Dump device resources

SYNOPSIS:

        res_dump

DESCRIPTION:

        res_dump is a tool written on top of drgn, for dumping device
        resources. That way it is possible to directly find out device resources
        without relying on tools such as devlink(8) that only provide an
        abstraction.

OUTPUT

        As an output, res_dump emits a JSON object with the following
        attributes:

        .<resource-name>.id
            The identifier of the device resource.

        .<resource-name>.valid
	    Whether the resource is valid or not. Invalid resources are
            ignored by mlxsw.

        .<resource-name>.value
            The value of the device resource, as queried from the
            device.

        res_dump always outputs the complete information. Filtering and
        querying can be done e.g. through `jq`.

EXAMPLE:

    # res_dump | jq
    {
      "KVD_SIZE": {
        "id": "0x1001",
        "valid": true,
        "value": 524288
      },
      [...]
      "MAX_NVE_MC_ENTRIES_IPV6": {
        "id": "0x2e03",
        "valid": true,
        "value": 4
      }
    }
